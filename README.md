# sorting-algorithms

This project has the objective of studying sorting algorithms and C++.

It is a simple program that prompts the user to input the number of elements that will be stored in a dynamically allocated array, to input the way that it is ordered (i.e. Crescent, Decrescent or Random) and to input the sorting algorithm.

Finally the program outputs the time consumed just to sort the array.

## Currently included sorting algorithms:
- bubble sort
- insertion sort
- selection sort
- quicksort
